# Code Clarity AI - HackWestern12 🏆 

## Overview

During my last internship, I kept running into the same problem over and over: the documentation never matched the actual state of the service. I'd get assigned a ticket, open the docs, and immediately realize half of it was outdated. Then I'd spend hours digging through files, tracing logic, and asking around just to understand the basics before I could even start coding. It slowed everything down and felt like wasted effort.

Code Clarity was built out of that frustration. The goal is simple — keep your documentation accurate and up-to-date automatically, so engineers can spend their time actually building instead of trying to piece together how a system works.

This tool reads your code, generates clear documentation, and updates it whenever the code changes. The whole point is to shrink the gap between getting a task and actually understanding the parts of the system involved.

## What It Does

- Generates documentation straight from your codebase
- Automatically refreshes docs when things change
- Helps new engineers understand systems faster
- Cuts out wasted hours caused by outdated, incomplete, or forgotten documentation

## Why It Exists

Because I was tired of feeling lost in services that had "documentation" in name only. This project took a lot of late nights, second-guessing, trial and error, and more stubbornness than I planned for. But it solves a problem that every engineer runs into at some point.
